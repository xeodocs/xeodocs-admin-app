Analyze the GitHub repository configured MCP server: `github-mcp-server`.
Focus your analysis on:
- The `openapi/api-design/openapi-design.yaml` file for OpenAPI specification details (e.g., schemas, endpoints, and API structure).
- The `docs/` directory for system design explanations (e.g., architecture, workflows, and documentation).
- Ignore unrelated files like build configs (e.g., `astro.config.mjs`, `Dockerfile.starlight`).
